                <h1>About Me</h1>  
                    <br>  
                    <p>Juliana Tisker was born and raised in San Francisco in the Excelsior District and is a first-generation child of immigrants from Argentina. She lives at home with her parents and has two older sisters and two dogs, Bruno, a 9-year-old golden doodle, and Oliver, an 11-year-old dachshund. She is fortunate to have grown up in a city that is so diverse and this has allowed her to meet people of all backgrounds, creating some amazing friendships and learning so much in the process. Being from a Latino background has also opened doors for her in many ways, allowing her to communicate with people from different countries, educate herself in both Spanish and English, and connect with her roots.

                    <br>
                    Some of her hobbies include taking her dogs Bruno and Oliver on walks around the city, playing soccer, baking, trying new coffee shops with friends, and going on runs. She also loves to travel, whether it be a staycation here in California or an international trip, she is always open to an adventure and getting to know a new place.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She is currently a student at San Francisco State University pursuing a double major in Marketing and Visual Communications with a minor in Ethnic Studies. Although she is just beginning her design journey, in the future she hopes to combine all her previous knowledge and pursue a career in UX/UI design or web design. She is very interested in the process of designing interfaces that work well for everyone and believes that her background, both academic and cultural, will help her succeed. Juliana is sure that her background in Marketing and Ethnic Studies will help her to better understand her users by creating accessible interfaces and help her pinpoint selling points that need to be highlighted. In addition, her background as a woman, Latina, and SF native, adds to her unique style of designing and will help her differentiate herself from other designers. Overall, she is excited to continue her journey to become a successful designer!
